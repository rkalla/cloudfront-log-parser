This package is meant to contain any number of *real* CloudFront logs. Running
LogParserTest.testRealSamples() will automatically parse all the files in this
package and do a full test sweep on them.

Due to the sensitive nature of server logs, this package will remain empty
in Git, but you are free to drop your OWN logs into this package if you wanted
to run some tests.
